# Breast-Cancer-
The aim of this project is to develop and test a number of Machine Learning algorithms using neural networks to predict and classify breast cancer occurrence and also compare their performances in terms of key techniques and metrics such as accuracy and precision. The results produced are ambitious and may be applied to assist clinical decisions in order to raise the standard of care for breast cancer patients.
The empirical evidence drawn in this research gives a comparability with, and corroborates the findings of extant research. A testament to the effectiveness of the models built in this project.
